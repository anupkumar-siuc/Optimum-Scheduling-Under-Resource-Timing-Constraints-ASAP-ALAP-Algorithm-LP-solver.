// 1. Read the benchmark files(.asapalap) and store it in your own defined data structure 
// 2. Form the linear equations using the information in the data structure and print in a file(ilpfile) 
// 3. Use lp solver to solve the inequalities and store the output of lpsolver in file.
      //lpsover command: lp_solve "ilpfile" 
// 4. The two functions(get_token,isdelim) can be used for reading the benchmark files(.asapalap). 
      //Using these two functions in your implementation is optional.
